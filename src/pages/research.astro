                    My current research interests are centered around the <i>biological</i> and
                    <i>artificial</i> representations of information flow. Some fundamental questions
                    motivating my investigations are:

                    <ul class="motivation-list">
                        <li>How artificially intelligent behavior <i>can emerge</i> from biological intelligence</li>
                        <li>How to perceive <i>biological intelligence</i> from the point of <i>cortical networks</i></li>
                        <li>How to interpret <i>geometrical representations of cognition</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Most of these topics have long been explored but are certainly of great interest today, owing 
                    to advances in computational methods that reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence. Taking
                    a step back from the capital-driven AI landscape and realizing the intriguing nature of intelligence
                    would point a different picture: one where intelligence and mathematics are forever embedded, where
                    philosophical discussions on mind and language can indeed be investigated on a cortical level and where,
                    quite possibly, our current ideas of intelligence are vastly distant from their biologically emergent
                    counterparts. 
                    
                    To bridge this gap it is essential to take neurocomputations on a biological level as guidance and investigate
                    cortical networks and cognitive functions. If emergence of intelligence can be accurately modeled it is 
                    obvious many astounding discoveries on psychology, language and cognition will be made possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The driving force of this discovery can only be, against all the interests of corporations and governments, to
                    discover scientific links to intelligence and motivate the creativity of humankind.

                As a brief sidenote, I am also concurrently working in more robotics-based applications of AI, specifically
                on metalearnable dynamical identification. Even though this is secondary to my neuroscientific interests
                I would be happy to discuss anything related to it.
