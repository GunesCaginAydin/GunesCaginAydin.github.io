            Now how were we saying that thing, cool?
            <br>
            But the beautiful is mostly ugly, truth only lies to us and we see terrible needs in our good saints.
            <br>
            So why define cool in everything that we know to be so subjective.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cool is capital.
            <br>
            Cool is machinary that gnaws our bodies.
            <br>
            Cool is nostalgia broken, mind split, spirit shattered.
